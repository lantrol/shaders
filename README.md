# Shaders:
In this repository I'll save the programs that I do while I try to learn the use of GLSL.
I will comment the code a bit as notes to help myself and whoever finds them interesting.

## Conway's Game Of Life:
Classic Game Of Life simulation made with Python and GLSL, using PyGame and ModernGL libraries.
Helpful to understand the basics of textures and framebuffers.
